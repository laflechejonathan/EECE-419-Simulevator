		// right now but at some point you're gonna go to this floor.. Once you
		// get to that floor you're going to access that structure for that
		// floor which has a bunch of passengers that are constantly chilling.
		// And you will take those passengers you see and get them onboard and
		// put them in your passenger list. Once that happens you'll be like
		// sweet I have these passengers they want to go places. And you'll go
		// to those places.
